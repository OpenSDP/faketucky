## OpenSDP Faketucky College-Going Dataset (Stata and R)

### Description

The Faketucky synthetic college-going analysis file contains high school and
college outcome data for two graduating cohorts of approximately 40,000
students. There are no real children in the dataset, but it mirrors the
relationships between variables present in real data.

Faketucky is a demonstration of using machine learning routines to
develop synthetic data based on real datasets. It was developed as an offshoot
of the Strategic Data Project's
[college-going diagnostic for Kentucky](https://sdp.cepr.harvard.edu/kentucky-college-going),
using the R [synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html)
package. Synthetic datasets like Faketucky can be shared freely for teaching
and collaboration, and they can be used to test hypotheses before applying for
permission to use confidential data.

### Contents

This repository contains the following files:

- `faketucky.dta` is a college-going analysis data file in Stata format
- `faketucky.rda` is the same data in R format
- `faketucky_codebook.txt` contains variable names and descriptions
